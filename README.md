# dont-delete-me

The idea is to build a single page web application, but I will need Node js to handle some post requests such as sending emails, 
putting some new posts, etc...

It seems that I don't have a full control over application, because sometimes it crashes for weird reasons. 

What is even more important is if you can send me documentation for that SEND button, when I press SEND not to rerender whole page, just to send message, so what should I do? I am rerendering it with nodejs because I don't know what else to do
